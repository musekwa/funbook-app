**Master state management from hooks and context through to Redux, MobX, XState, Jotai and React Query**

## What is this book about?

Managing state in a React Native app can be challenging as it is one of the most difficult concepts to grasp while learning React Native. This is because there are so many ways to do it, and because there is a lack of clear guidelines on what should be used and why.

This book covers the following exciting features:

- Start out by going over the basic ReactJS “mindset”
- Explore all that ReactJS has to offer to manage state in apps by building an app
- Understand existing state management libraries such as Redux, MobX, XState, Jotai, and React Query
- Decide which libraries you want to use in your apps
- Design a social media app to fully understand state management
- Try out all the solutions presented in the book in a social media clone app

## Instructions and Navigations

All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:

```
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {name: "World"}
  };
  render() {
    return <Text>Hello, {this.state.name}</Text>;
   }
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for junior developers, React Native developers, and mobile app developers who are already using React Native, but are also on the lookout for advice and for a broader view to manage the state and changes in their applications. Basic knowledge of ReactJS and React Native, as well as familiarity with JavaScript and general mobile app development concepts are needed to grasp the topics covered in this book.

We also provide a PDF file that has color images of the screenshots/diagrams used in this book. [Click here to download it](https://packt.link/wv4Mk).
